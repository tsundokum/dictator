Once upon a time, high up in the bright blue sky, there lived a small, fluffy cloud named Pip. Pip was the youngest cloud in the sky, and he loved to watch everything happening below.
Every day, Pip would see birds flying, children playing, and flowers swaying in the wind. But what Pip loved most was watching the leaves dance when the wind blew through the trees.
"I wish I could dance like that!" Pip said to his friend, a big cloud named Bella.
Bella smiled. "But you're a cloud, Pip. Clouds don't dance. We just float and drift."
Pip felt sad. He wanted to dance SO badly! He tried spinning around and around, but he just made himself dizzy. He tried bouncing up and down, but he only gave himself a tummy ache.
One morning, a friendly bluebird flew past. "Why do you look so sad, little cloud?" she chirped.
"I want to dance, but I don't know how," Pip sighed.
The bluebird thought for a moment. "Have you tried dancing with the wind?"
"The wind?" Pip asked.
"Yes! The wind makes everything dance - the trees, the flowers, even me! Maybe the wind can help you too!"
Pip got very excited. He waited and waited. Soon, he felt a gentle breeze tickle his fluffy sides. Instead of fighting it, Pip let the wind guide him. He swirled left, then right. He drifted up, then swooped down. He twirled and whirled across the sky!
"I'm dancing! I'm REALLY dancing!" Pip shouted with joy.
The wind carried Pip over mountains and valleys, over rivers and forests. Everywhere Pip danced, his shadow danced on the ground below. Children pointed up at him and laughed with delight.
Bella drifted over with the other clouds. "Pip, you did it! You found your own special way to dance!"
From that day on, whenever the wind blew, Pip would dance across the sky. Sometimes he danced slowly and gracefully. Sometimes he danced fast and silly. And sometimes, all the clouds would join in, making beautiful patterns across the sky.
And down below, whenever children saw the clouds moving and swirling, they knew that Pip was up there, dancing with joy.
The End.
